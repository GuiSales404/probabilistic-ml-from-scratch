# Probabilistic Machine Learning from Scratch

## About the Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with implementations of probabilistic machine learning algorithms crafted from scratch. These activities were undertaken while studying advanced topics in machine learning as part of the undergraduate computing course at UFC (Universidade Federal do Cear√°).

## Notebooks Included

- `GMM_Expectation_Maximization.ipynb` - Gaussian Mixture Models and Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
- `Linear_and_logistic_bayesian_regression.ipynb` - Bayesian approaches to linear and logistic regression.
- `Probabilistic_PCA.ipynb` - Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis implementation.
- `discrete_generative_model.ipynb` - Discrete generative models for data analysis.
- `variational_inference_and_gaussian_process.ipynb` - Variational inference methods and Gaussian processes.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project assumes you have Python 3 installed on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GuiSales404/probabilistic-ml-from-scratch.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
  cd probabilistic-ml-from-scratch

3. Install the required packages:
  unfortunately I forgot to save the libraries used(sorry ;-;), but it is definitely necessary:
    - Numpy
    - Matplotlib
    - Scipy
    - Seaborn
